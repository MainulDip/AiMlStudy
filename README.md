## Overview:
This is a personalized repo aming Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Study and Quick Jump Start Guide.

> A.I: The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans. From tic-tac-toe games to more complex things that simulate some form of intelligence. 

> M.L: Machine learning is a form of AI. It uses data from tons of examples instade of hard coded programme and predict the best case scenarios. It not 100% correct every time. To get the highest accuracy is the goal of machine learning model/algorithm. So Rather than giving the program the rules, the algorithm finds the rule for us.


> Neural Network: A form of machine learning that uses layered representation of data. In NN we have multiple layer of data. 
"Nural Network is a multistage information extraction process"

Feature & Lable: Feature is the input information. Lable is the predection (output) based on Feature.

Data: Combination of all the Features and lables (traning phase). 

### Machine Learning Types:
- Unsupervised Learning
    When we only have features. We let model group the features on their position

- Supervised Learning:
    It has both Features and Lable data for model traning. Most common type.

- Reinforcement Learning: 
    When we have no data (Features and lable). Agent, Environment, Exploring and Reward (Negative and Positive). The practicality is to let A.I to play games.
