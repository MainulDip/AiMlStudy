## Overview:
This is a personalized repo aming Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Study and Quick Jump Start Guide.

> A.I: The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans. From tic-tac-toe games to more complex things that simulate some form of intelligence. 

> M.L: Machine learning is a form of AI. It uses data from tons of examples instade of hard coded programme and predict the best case scenarios. It not 100% correct every time. To get the highest accuracy is the goal of machine learning model/algorithm. So Rather than giving the program the rules, the algorithm finds the rule for us.
