### Overview:
Scikit-Learn (sklearn) is a python machine learning library.
- Built on NumPy and Matplotlib
- has many in-built machine learning models
- methods to evaluate models
- very well designed
### Workflows:
- Get data ready
- pick a model
- fit the model to the data and make a prediction
- evaluate the model
- improve through experimentation
- save and reload trained modelss
