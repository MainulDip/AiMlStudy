### Linear Regration:
Linear regression follows a very simple concept. If data points are related linearly, we can generate a line of best fit for these points and use it to predict future values.

```py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = [1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4]
y = [1, 4, 7, 9, 15]
plt.plot(x, y, 'ro')
plt.axis([0, 6, 0, 20])
```
We can see that this data has a linear coorespondence. When the x value increases, so does the y. Because of this relation we can create a line of best fit for this dataset. In this example our line will only use one input variable, as we are working with two dimensions. In larger datasets with more features our line will have more features and inputs.

"Line of best fit refers to a line through a scatter plot of data points that best expresses the relationship between those points." (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/line-of-best-fit.asp)

Here's a refresher on the equation of a line in 2D.

y=mx+b

Here's an example of a line of best fit for this graph.
```py
plt.plot(x, y, 'ro')
plt.axis([0, 6, 0, 20])
plt.plot(np.unique(x), np.poly1d(np.polyfit(x, y, 1))(np.unique(x)))
plt.show()
```
