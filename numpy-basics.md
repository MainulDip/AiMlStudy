### Numpy vs Python List:
Numpy (Numerical Python) is written in c, that's why it's way faster than python's list in terms of list related operations (heavy/large-scale computation). 
- behind the scenes optimization written in C
- Vectorization via broadcasting (avoiding loops)
- Backbone of Python scientific packages as well as AI/ML
